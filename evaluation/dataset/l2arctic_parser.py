L2-ARCTIC (v5.0) -> the SRT trees and paths lists the evaluation reads.

    python evaluation/dataset/l2arctic_parser.py --base /path/to/l2arctic_release_v5.0

Non-native English: 24 speakers, six first languages (Arabic, Mandarin, Hindi, Korean,
Spanish, Vietnamese), four speakers each. Two datasets come out of it:

  l2arctic           the 3,599 read CMU-ARCTIC sentences that have a manual annotation
                     (about 150 per speaker). One clip = one sentence = one segment, as TIMIT.
                     -> tmp/data/l2arctic_data/<SPK>/<utt>.srt.json, tmp/paths/l2arctic_paths_all.json
  l2arctic_suitcase  the 22 retellings of the "suitcase story", spontaneous, about a minute
                     each. Cut into segments at pauses, as Buckeye (`split_narrative`).
                     -> tmp/data/l2arctic_suitcase_data/<spk>.srt.json, tmp/paths/l2arctic_suitcase_paths_all.json

The ~23,000 sentences WITHOUT a manual annotation are not used: their only labels are the
corpus's own forced alignment, made with MFA 1.0, which cannot be a reference for scoring an
aligner. Bear in mind that the manual annotations started from that forced alignment too: in
the sentences, 88.8% of the annotated phone onsets are exactly where MFA 1.0 put them (the
annotators moved 11%, by a median of 10 ms). `boundaries_moved` lists the ones that were moved.

## What the aligner gets, and what it is scored against

The TEXT is what the speaker was asked to say: the prompt in `transcript/` (sentences), or the
words tier (suitcase). The audio is what they did say, with the mispronunciations the
annotators marked. That mismatch is the point of the corpus here: the aligner has a correct
transcript of imperfect speech.

A segment's `boundaries` (ms from the segment start) are the onsets of every interval the
speaker produced: a correct phone, a substitution (`CPL,PPL,s`, the phone that was heard
starts there, even when the annotator wrote `err`) and an addition (`sil,PPL,a`, a phone that
is in the audio and not in the text). A deletion (`CPL,sil,d`) produced nothing, so it starts
no boundary; the phone after it does. Silence (`sil`, `sp`, unlabelled) and spoken noise
(`spn`) start none.

Each segment also carries, for analyses beyond the main score (the scorer ignores them):
  boundaries_error  the onsets that start or end an error interval (s / a / d)
  boundaries_moved  the onsets the annotators moved off the MFA 1.0 alignment (sentences only)

`phones` is the annotation tier whole, in ms from the start of the recording; `local_ph` is
the PERCEIVED phone in the std phoneme set (latin local ids, see std_labels.py).
